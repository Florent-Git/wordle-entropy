# Wordle

This is my implementation of Wordle based on the [Ink](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink) library. This implementation is meant to be used with the [information theory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v68zYyaEmEA&t=247s&pp=ygUSd29yZGxlIDNibHVlMWJyb3du) from 3blue1brown's video, but with many other languages as a goal.

When I'll have time, I'll try with french, then maybe I'll move on with Japanese, たぶん.
